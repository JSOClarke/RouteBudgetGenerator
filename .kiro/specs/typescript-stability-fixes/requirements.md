# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical TypeScript stability issues in the RouteGen application to ensure proper type safety, eliminate compilation errors, and improve code maintainability. The focus is on essential fixes that will make the application stable without changing core functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript type definitions throughout the codebase, so that I can catch errors at compile time and have better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN importing papaparse THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions available
3. WHEN using any function parameters THEN they SHALL have explicit type annotations
4. WHEN defining component props THEN they SHALL use proper TypeScript interfaces

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper data structure interfaces, so that the application has consistent data handling and type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling postcode data THEN the system SHALL use a defined Postcode interface
2. WHEN working with coordinate data THEN the system SHALL use a defined Coordinate type
3. WHEN managing cost configuration THEN the system SHALL use a defined CostConfig interface
4. WHEN handling matrix data THEN the system SHALL use proper matrix type definitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component props to be properly typed, so that components have clear contracts and prevent runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MatrixTable component receives props THEN it SHALL accept all required props including prices
2. WHEN App component passes props to MatrixTable THEN the types SHALL be compatible
3. WHEN event handlers are defined THEN they SHALL have proper event type annotations
4. WHEN callback functions are used THEN they SHALL have explicit parameter types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling types, so that error states are handled consistently throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN catching errors in try-catch blocks THEN the error SHALL be properly typed
2. WHEN handling API errors THEN the system SHALL use consistent error types
3. WHEN displaying error messages THEN the error handling SHALL be type-safe
4. WHEN error states are managed THEN they SHALL use proper TypeScript types
